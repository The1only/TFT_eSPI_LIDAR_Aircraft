150US$ Laser Altitude Indicator for Sports planes...

**********************************************************************************
* Laser Altitude Indicator v1.0
* By Terje Nilsen, 2024
*
* This project uses a low-cost SEEED Rp2040 board (7,-US$), with a SEEED circular color display (20,-US$), and a Garmin v3 LIDAR (120,-US$)
* **(Total cost 150US$ total + 3D printed box or something).**
* You get RTC, LIDAR, SD-Card socket for logging, Touch screen, Color Graphics, USB-Serial, IO pins for control or sensing etc. 
*
* It measures the actual AGL when close to ground, and can be used for low pass training etc. 
* In addition to the display output, it can be set to send the output over USB-Serial port to 
* an external device, like Android phone etc.for logging or cool apps.
* Many cool additions can be written, and as the touchscreen works (even through glass) one can have different screens by push.
* Today two different screens are implemented just to show how.
* As of the RTC, an automatic flight time recorder can be implemented. 
* 
* This project and all its code is free to use, but send pull request with updates.
* However; if it is used commercially, my name shall be listed.
